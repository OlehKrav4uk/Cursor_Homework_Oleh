            <h2>Basic info</h2>
            <p>
                Amanita muscaria (and another similar variety, Amanita pantherina) is a mushroom of the agaricales order that appears in very broad habitats of the temperate and boreal zones of the Northern Hemisphere. It grows both in low altitudes and high mountainous areas, especially in coniferous forests such as fir and black pine, as well as in beech and birch forests. It usually appears during the end of summer months and is especially prevalent in autumn.
            </p>
            <p>
                This mushroom contains two psychoactive alkaloids, ibotenic acid and muscimol, in addition to many other alkaloids. It has been used since antiquity as an intoxicating substance as well as in shamanic contexts and divination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name Amanita muscaria comes from the paralyzing effect it has on some insects. It is known by other names such as hongo matamoscas in Spanish, falsa oronja, reig bord or farinera borda in Catalan, and fly agaric in English.

            <h2>Origin/History</h2>
            <p>
                Historical records such as cave paintings, wood carvings and sculptures suggest that the psychoactive effects of A. muscaria have been known since ancient times on all continents, and similar practices have been observed regarding the use of A. muscaria in groups both geographically and culturally distant. A. muscaria has been used for religious, divination, therapeutic and social purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first evidence of the use of A. muscaria as an intoxicant is based on linguistic analyses of North Asian languages from 4000 BC, in which the roots of the words “drunkenness” and Amanita muscaria appear to be the same. Polychromatic paintings have been found on Saharan rocks dating back to the Paleolithic period; depictions of what appear to be mushrooms of the Amanita genus, probably of the muscaria species.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fungus grows naturally in the highlands of Mesoamerica and some mushroom myths and sculptures suggest the use of A. muscaria in Guatemala and southern Mexico at the time of creation of the Mayan civilization, around 1500 – 1000 BC. Some symbolic similarities have been found in Guatemalan and Asian populations relating to the belief that the mushroom is born in places where lightning strikes. These parallels could be explained by the migrations that likely occurred from the Asian continent to the Americas via the Bering Strait, thus the knowledge about the use of A. muscaria would have been relayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first Western report on the use of A. muscaria was made by Filip Johan von Strahlenberg, a Swedish soldier who, in 1730, was imprisoned for twelve years in Siberia. He observed how A. muscaria was used as an intoxicant in shamanic contexts. Currently the Ostyak and Vogul tribes, west of Siberia, and the Kamchadal, Koryak, and Chukchi tribes in the east, continue to use A. muscariain their rites.

            <h2>Effects</h2>
        <p>
            Both muscimol and ibotenic acid have psychotropic effects. After oral administration, the effects take quite a long time to appear, and it usually takes 2 to 3 hours to reach the maximum effects. The duration of the effects is about 6 or 8 hours, depending on the dose.The nature of the effects can be highly variable, also depending on the dose, as well as the variety and personal differences.
        </p>
        <h2>Effects may include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A first phase in which there is stimulation, increased energy and muscular vigor (not always).</li>
            <li>A second phase in which there is decay, tranquility and drowsiness.</li>
            <li>A third phase in which the psychedelic effects appear and there may be experiences of a mystical nature, awareness of non-ordinary realities, blissful or terrifying sensations.</li>
            <li>Visual distortions.</li>
            <li>Loss of balance.</li>
            <li>Muscle spasms.</li>
            <li>Experiences of a dream-like nature.</li>
            <li>Dizziness.</li>
            <li>Visual and auditory impairment.</li>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating on external tasks.</li>
            <li>Sensation of macropsia and/or micropsia (perceiving objects as either very large or very small).</li>
            <li>Nausea and vomiting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The effects of A. muscaria can take up to 2 or 3 hours to appear. Being very careful with the amount ingested is recommended (no more than a small or medium cap), as is waiting a few hours to see the progression of the effects. The potency of the mushroom can be highly variable, so be careful with the dosage.
